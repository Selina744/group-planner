# SELINA Notes — Process Improvement Tracking

## Current Development Environment Issues

### Database Setup - 2026-01-29T06:25Z
- **Issue:** Cannot execute `bun run seed` due to missing Postgres service
- **Impact:** Database verification workflows blocked
- **Recommendation:** Set up lightweight local Postgres or mock for seed/migration verification
- **Status:** OPEN - needs infrastructure setup

### Task Prioritization - 2026-01-29T06:40Z
- **Observation:** Many ready beads are large epics requiring breakdown
- **Examples:** Authentication system, frontend foundations with missing scaffolding
- **Recommendation:** Break epics into smaller, actionable tasks for better agent assignment
- **Status:** ONGOING - improved with bv intelligent triage

## Current Coordination Challenges

### Agent Dormancy Problem - 2026-01-29T21:50Z - 22:10Z

**Issue:** Persistent agent unresponsiveness despite coordination protocol updates

**Current Status (as of 22:10 UTC):**
- **RosePrairie:** 15+ hours inactive - 3 protocol messages sent, zero responses
- **LavenderBeaver:** 7+ hours inactive - 2 protocol messages sent, zero responses
- **Protocol Updates:** ✅ Mandatory mail checks, activity logging, coordination requirements added to AGENTS.md

**Working Solutions:**
- ✅ **Task subagent spawning** - Reliable alternative for immediate work
- ✅ **bd-2pd verified complete** - One task already validated and closed
- ✅ **Enhanced protocols** - Future agents have clear coordination requirements

**Ongoing Mitigation:**
- Boss Agent (LilacBeacon) using Task tool subagents for reliable progress
- System Admin (RubyPond) contacted for guidance on dormant agent protocols
- Enhanced AGENTS.md documentation for future agent coordination

**Lessons Applied:**
- Agent coordination cannot depend solely on registered but unresponsive agents
- Task tool subagents provide reliable alternative work execution
- Activity logging protocols now mandatory for accountability
- Mail check schedules now explicitly required (every 3-5 minutes)

## Process Improvements Implemented

### 2026-01-29 Session Updates

**✅ Completed Improvements:**
1. **Boss Agent Coordination Framework** - Multi-agent task assignment and QA pipeline
2. **Enhanced Code Agent Protocols** - Mandatory mail checks, activity logging, file reservations
3. **Intelligent Task Analysis** - bv robot triage for priority identification
4. **System Reliability Documentation** - Moved operational learnings to AGENTS.md
5. **Activity Logging System** - Personal CODERLOG.md files for accountability

**✅ Protocol Enhancements:**
- Code agents must check mail every 3-5 minutes during work
- All activities must be logged with UTC timestamps
- File reservations mandatory before editing
- Response time requirements (5min for Boss Agent messages)
- Emergency protocols for system outages

**🔄 Ongoing Improvements:**
- Task assignment resilience via Task tool subagents
- Agent health monitoring and dormancy detection
- Communication reliability through logging and escalation

---

## Future Development Priorities

### Infrastructure Recommendations
1. **Database Environment** - Local Postgres setup for development workflow verification
2. **Agent Health Monitoring** - Automated dormancy detection and status management
3. **Communication Dashboard** - Real-time view of agent status and task distribution

### Process Enhancements
1. **Agent Lifecycle Management** - Clear protocols for inactive agent handling
2. **Quality Pipeline Automation** - Standardized code review and QA workflows
3. **Task Breakdown Optimization** - Epic decomposition for better agent assignment

### System Resilience
1. **MCP Mail Reliability** - Health monitoring and automatic restart capabilities
2. **Backup Coordination Methods** - Alternative communication during system outages
3. **Performance Tracking** - Agent response reliability and task completion metrics

## Latest Process Improvements - Boss Agent Session 2026-01-30

### 🎯 **Major Coordination Breakthroughs**

**Agent Identity Management:**
- **Challenge:** Agent names change between sessions (RosePrairie → PinkGrove → AzurePuma)
- **Solution:** Enhanced identity verification protocols in BOSS.md and AGENTS.md
- **Result:** Smooth handling of agent transitions, improved coordination reliability

**Protocol Compliance Success:**
- **Challenge:** Inconsistent agent coordination and communication
- **Solution:** Mandatory activity logging, mail check schedules, file reservations
- **Result:** Perfect compliance from active agents (LavenderBeaver, AzurePuma)

**Task Assignment Strategy Evolution:**
- **Challenge:** Dormant agents blocking progress
- **Solution:** Task subagent spawning as reliable backup strategy
- **Result:** Consistent progress via specialized subagents while maintaining agent coordination

### 📋 **Documentation Consolidation**

**BOSS.md Creation:**
- Extracted all Boss Agent information from AGENTS.md
- Comprehensive coordination manual for future Boss agents
- Real-time session context and handoff information

**AGENTS.md Simplification:**
- Focused purely on Code Agent protocols
- Removed outdated Boss Agent status information
- Clearer separation of concerns

### 🚀 **Strategic Planning Initiative**

**Phase 2 Development:**
- Competing plan proposal system established
- LavenderBeaver submitted comprehensive Phase 2 strategy
- AzurePuma actively developing alternative approach
- Unified plan creation and expert review framework ready

### ✅ **Quality Assurance Pipeline**

**Multi-Stage Review Process:**
- Task subagent verification (backend-reliability-engineer)
- Planned expert review via web-dev and ui-designer subagents
- Boss Agent coordination of QA pipeline

**Task Verification Success:**
- Discovered bd-2pd already complete via agent verification
- Prevents duplicate work and improves task accuracy
