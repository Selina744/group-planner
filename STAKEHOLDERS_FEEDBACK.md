# Stakeholder feedback

## Phase 1

### First iteration

- "Launch a better group trip" at the top seems kinda small and out of place. See if the ux expert can come up with something better.
- Each of the items under "What makes group-planner different" highlights as you hover over it, but is not clickable, so that's a bit confusing. Maybe if they expanded a bit to be more readable or show more information. Or if they navigated to documentation that explained more about that feature.
- The numbers about how many trips have been planned and stuff doesn't really make sense for a self hosted app. It seems kinda like marketing. Maybe it could go in a statistics feature though, or for when we decide to host an instance ourselves for people to sign up on with some way to monetize it enough to pay for server costs.
- Can't figure out how to do user registration and authentication
- Can't figure out how to create a trip. The "Start planning your trip" button doesn't do anything.
- Tests still need to be implemented
- Seeding database not working
