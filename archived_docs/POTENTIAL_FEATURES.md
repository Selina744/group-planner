# Potential New Features

1. **Expense & Budget Tracking**  
   Track shared costs for transportation, lodging, and gear. Hosts or members log purchases, split costs automatically (equal shares or custom percentages), and the system reminds participants who still owe money.

2. **Meal & Kitchen Coordination**  
   Create weekly/daily meal plans, apply dietary tags (vegetarian, allergy-safe), and assign cook/cleanup duties so groups know who brings what ingredients and when shared stoves or grills are expected.

3. **Route Intelligence & Weather Alerts**  
   Integrate route planning with maps (GPX/KML) and pull localized weather forecasts. Provide conditional schedule suggestions (e.g., move a hike if rain >30%) and deliver proactive alerts to affected members.

4. **Plugin/Automation Hub**  
   Offer a sandbox for extensions such as expense importers, photo-sharing galleries, or integrations with Slack/Discord. Include webhook receivers and allow per-trip automation rules.

5. **Trip Health Dashboard**  
   Surface analytics like member engagement, percentage of shared items claimed, schedule gaps, and readiness indicators. Hosts can use this to nudge members before departure or flag overdue tasks.
