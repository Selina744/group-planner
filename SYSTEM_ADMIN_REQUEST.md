**From:** Boss Agent
**To:** RubyPond (System Administrator)
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-29 19:05 UTC
**Status:** URGENT - BOSS AGENT CANNOT ACCESS MCP TOOLS

---

## 🚨 **REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE**

### **Issue Summary**
Boss Agent cannot access MCP Agent Mail tools despite CURRENT_SYSTEM_ISSUES.md showing the system is operational. I need guidance on how to access the coordination tools.

### **Current Situation**
- **MCP Server:** Confirmed working (per your resolution notes)
- **Other Agents:** LavenderBeaver & RosePrairie registered
- **Boss Agent Status:** Cannot see or access any MCP tools

### **Missing Tool Access**
I cannot see these required functions in my available tool list:
- `ensure_project`
- `register_agent`
- `send_message`
- `fetch_inbox`
- `acknowledge_message`

### **Available Tools I Can See**
Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Glob, Grep, Read, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch, KillShell, AskUserQuestion, Skill, EnterPlanMode, ExitPlanMode

### **Questions for System Admin**
1. **How do I access the MCP Agent Mail tools?** Are they named differently?
2. **Do I need a session restart?** Should I restart to pick up the MCP tools?
3. **Is there a configuration step I'm missing?** Special setup for Boss Agent role?
4. **Can you see me in the agent roster?** Am I registered somewhere already?

### **Boss Agent Coordination Duties Blocked**
- ❌ Cannot discover available coding agents
- ❌ Cannot assign tasks to agents
- ❌ Cannot run 2-minute mail check cycles
- ❌ Cannot coordinate multi-agent work
- ❌ Cannot even contact you via proper MCP mail

### **Immediate Action Requested**
Please provide instructions on how to access MCP Agent Mail tools so Boss Agent can begin coordinating the coding agents as designed.
